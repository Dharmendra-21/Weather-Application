The main objective of this project is to develop a web-based application that provides users with accurate and real-time weather information for any location worldwide.

The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Rapid Weather APIs and Unsplash APIs.
HTML is used for structuring the content of the web pages.
CSS is used for styling the web pages to make them visually appealing.
JavaScript is used for adding interactivity to the web pages. It handles the logic of fetching and displaying data from the Rapid Weather APIs.
Rapid weather APIs provide real-time weather data. The application makes HTTP requests to these APIs to fetch the required weather data of a particular location.
Unsplash APIs are used to display a relevant background image based on the current weather conditions of the searched location.

For implementation of this project, I used VS Code which is a very good platform for Web Development.
